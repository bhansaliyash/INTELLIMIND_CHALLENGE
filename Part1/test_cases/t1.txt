Global warming has hugely impacted the environment and human life to a great extent for many years. The level of sea water is increasing continuously every year and creating fear for the nearby cities, islands and seawater animals. Rainfall pattern has also disturbed which causes drought in some areas and flooding in other areas. Ice caps and glaciers are melting continuously and its level depends on the increased level of temperature. It is causing loss of habitat near to the poles and polar bears have greatly endangered. Wild animals living in the forest are endangered because of their habitat loss due to deforestation.

Bleaching of Coral Reefs and loss of Plankton are done due to warming seas and acidification (carbonic acid formation. Various types of diseases are also spreading especially malaria to the nearby regions. Now, it has become very necessary for the countries worldwide especially developed countries to reduce their carbon emission as quickly as possible. Limiting some of the promising sectors like coal-fired electricity and wind power can reduce in carbon emissions in nearby decades.
