Indians are extremely aware of the developments in the cryptocurrency market and the emerging trends. They are treating crypto-assets as a new investment asset class. This has given boost to top five cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin and Ripple. These account for almost 80 per cent of the total market capitalisation of the cryptocurrency universe and trade volume in India as well as globally. Indians have also taken a great interest in these cryptocurrencies.
